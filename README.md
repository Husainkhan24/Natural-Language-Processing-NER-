Clinical Text Classification Using NLP technique Name Entity Recognition

Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to answer a variety of questions about unstructured text, as well as facilitating open-ended exploration. It can be applied to datasets such as emails, online articles and comments, tweets and novels. Although the source is text, transformations are applied to convert this data to vectors, dictionaries and symbols which can be handled very effectively by q. Many operations such as searching, clustering, and keyword extraction can all be done using very simple data structures, such as feature vectors.
